## Issues and Bugs 

### Commit History

During development, developer made "git commit" comment after finishing major blocks of the website (eg. header, footer, page or its contents). The developer was not aware that it had to be done after every detail add. This was only pointed out after the first developing meeting with the mentor. At that point majority of website was finished and only few bugs were left to fix and write the **README** and **TESTING** files. Regarding the repeating messages in commit history of **README** and **TESTING** files, those files were edited in **github** and not in **gitpod** and the developer was not aware that they will appear to commit history.
After this issue was pointed out to the developer, deloper started adding commits after smaller eddies of the project.

Noteworthy list of issues encountered during development.

**Nav Bar Stiky Bug** - During development issue occur when trying to implement sticky to top feature to the navigation bar. The navigation bar would only be sticky for a part of the page and then stop. The solution was found on [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_navbar_sticky.asp "Link to w3schools sticky navigation explanationn"). After reading true the explanation and having the code the problem was that the sticky navigation stick to a particular section so the solution was to make a section for the entire page except the footer and add sticky feature to the header.

**Footer Not Always On The Bottom Bug** - During development issue occur where at shorter pages the footer would not be at the bottom and there would be a blank space. A solution was found on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/643879/css-to-make-html-page-footer-stay-at-bottom-of-the-page-with-a-minimum-height-b). By editing the section of a sticky navigation container to making it be 100% in height it made the page load on the entire screen height.

**Feature Container Alignment Bug** - During development feature alignment cause problems: whenever increasing the distends between each feature the food container would stack under the other three. Using **Bootstrap** .col class the columns would be divide early true the spaces, but whenever increasing the margin the columns would not behave as wanted. A solution was instead of increasing the morning to put every column, int to another column and use the **Bootstrap** provade gutters as the wanted spaces.

**Trainer Profile Picture Not Fitting Bug** - When applying the image to the trainer profile card the image would be too big and take up all the space of the screen. If tried to make the image smaller the image will be destroyed. Setting it up as a background image would make it be cut off and not the one-year image would be usable. The salute was found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3029422/how-do-i-auto-resize-an-image-to-fit-a-div-container "Image fitting to a container solution"). Soliution was to make image have max with and max height.

**Question Formu Background Color Bug** - After selecting the forum and inputting text background for mum's container would change color to black, but after not forcing it would go back to transparent. The solution was to add a focus subclass in style.css.
